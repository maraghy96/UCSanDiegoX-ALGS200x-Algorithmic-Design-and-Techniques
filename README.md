# UCSanDiegoX-ALGS200x-Algorithmic-Design-and-Techniques
Assignmenents of course UCSanDiegoX ALGS200x Algorithmic Design and Techniques: solving Algorithm problems using C++ and Java
**The idea here is to think about smart Algorithm to make the code faster and more effecient in matter of time and memory (Naive algorthims are neither accepted nor graded)
Description of the problems can be found in seperate PDF File including the expected results, inputs, expected outputs, time & memory constraints and some test cases
